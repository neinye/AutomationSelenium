What are the different types of waits available in Selenium WebDriver With Java Programming Language?
    2 types of wait:
    * implicit wait
    * explicit wait
 + Fluent wait - with this we can define the maximum amount of time to wait for a condition, as well as the frequency
with which to check the condition AND ignore some specific types of exceptions whilst waiting.

What is the difference between implicit wait and explicit wait?
If elements are not immediately available, an implicit wait tells Web Driver to poll the DOM for a certain amount of
time. The default setting is 0. Once set, the implicit wait is set fot the duration of the Web Driver object. This means
that we can tell Selenium WebDriver that we would like it to wait for a certain amount of time before throwing an
exception that it cannot find the element of the page.

Explicit wait:
It is the custom one. It will be used if we want the execution to wait for some time until some condition is achieved.
There can be an instance when a particular element takes more than a minute to load. In that case you definitely won't
like to set a huge amount of time to Implicit wait, as if you do this, your browser is going to wait for the same amount
of time for every element.
To avoid that situation, you can simply put a separate time on the required element only. By following this, your
browser implicit wait time would be short for every element and it would be large for a specific element.

What are some of the expected conditions?
* elementToBeClickable
* presenceOfElementLocated
* titleContains

If you use Implicit Wait of 10 seconds and Explicit Wait of 20 seconds, how much time Selenium WebDriver will wait
before timing out?
WARNING: Do not mix implicit and explicit waits. Doing so can cause unpredictable wait times. For example, setting an
implicit wait of 10 seconds and an explicit wait of 15 seconds, could cause a timeout to occur after 20 seconds.
